## Terminology

### SNP

A SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism - pronounced "snip") is a mutation in your genome. SNPs can tell you a lot about yourself (hair color, height, muscle type, allergies, response to disease, response to pharmaceuticals, heritage, etc.).

Your DNA file from any vendor will be a big list of these SNPs. Think of it like a diff against a reference human genome. Most vendors will compare your genome against [GRCh Build 37](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/2758/)

## Vendors

| Name | Supported | Price | Sample | Autosomal SNPs | Y SNPs | X SNPs | MT SNPs | Raw Data |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|----------------|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| 23andMe | Yes | 99 USD | Saliva | 967,000 | 3,089 | 26,087 | 2,737 | [Yes](https://www.23andme.com/you/download/) |
| ancestryDNA | Yes | 99 USD | Saliva | 682,549 | 885 | 17,604 | 0 | [Yes](http://ldna.ancestry.com/atFAQ.aspx#raw-3) |
| FamilyTree | Yes | 99 USD | Cheek Swab | 708,092 | 0 | 18,091 | 0 | [Yes](http://www.familytreedna.com/faq/answers.aspx?id=17#606) |

tl;dr use 23andMe they provide more data and are the cheapest

## CLI Usage

Use this if you just want to convert your data to the correct format so you can start querying your genome.

```
$ npm install dna2json -g
$ dna2json
Usage: dna2json <input file> <output file>
$ dna2json dna.txt dna.json
This will take a while...
```

## Module Usage

```javascript
var dna = require('dna2json');
var fs = require('fs');

// dna.createParser() returns a duplex stream
// input = text from your dna file
// output = SNPs as JSON
// to write to disk just pipe it to JSONStream then to fs

var txt = fs.readFileSync('dna.txt');
dna.parse(txt, function(err, snps){
  // snps = the object with your mutations
});
```

## SNP-JSON

Every vendor has their own format for your DNA. I decided to make a standard format called SNP-JSON. This library will convert custom formats to this standard.

SNP-JSON looks like this

```json
{
  "rs4477212": {
    "chromosome": 1,
    "genotype": "AA"
  },
  "rs3094315": {
    "chromosome": 1,
    "genotype": "AA"
  },
  "rs3131972": {
    "chromosome": 1,
    "genotype": "GG"
  },
  "rs12124819": {
    "chromosome": 1,
    "genotype": "AA"
  },
  "rs11240777": {
    "chromosome": 1,
    "genotype": "GG"
  },
  "rs6681049": {
    "chromosome": 1,
    "genotype": "CC"
  },
  ...
}
```

Explanation:

- The key is the RSID or vendor ID.
- Chromosome is which chromosome the data came from (1-22, X, Y, or MT).
- Genotype is the value for the RSID.

## Using your SNP-JSON

### Just Write Codeâ„¢

In this example we will determine if you are immune to norovirus:

```js
var dna = require('./dna.json');

if (dna.rs601338.genotype == 'AA') {
  // congrats you are immune!
}
```

### Genosets

Once you have your data in the right format you can use the library of genosets by genomejs.

You can view a list of these [by searching npm for genoset](https://npmjs.org/search?q=genoset)

You can also publish your own tools that analyze your DNA! Here is a tool that we recommend to get you started [GQL](https://github.com/genomejs/gql)
